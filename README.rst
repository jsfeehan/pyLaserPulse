pyLaserPulse
============


pyLaserPulse is a comprehensive simulation toolbox for modelling polarization-resolved, on-axis laser pulse propagation through nonlinear, dispersive, passive, and active optical fibre assemblies, stretchers, and compressors. pyLaserPulse was developed with rapid prototyping of pulsed fibre systems in mind, and includes: an extensive catalogue of preset models of off-the-shelf components, material reflectivites, Raman response functions and rare-earth spectroscopic data, base types for modelling custom components, and a flexible API.

pyLaserPulse can be used to build highly accurate models of any (quasi-) single-mode, solid-core fibre system producing output pulses with durations ranging from just a few optical cycles to multiple nanoseconds [#]_. This includes fibre amplifiers, mode-locked fibre lasers, and supercontinuum generation.

pyLaserPulse includes:
    * Models of single and double clad step-index [#]_ and photonic crystal [#]_ passive and active fibres.

    * Models of free-space and fibre-coupled components.

    * A polarization-resolved generalised nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (GNLSE) solver.

      - Fourth-order Runge-Kutta interaction picture method for integration (RK4IP) [#]_.

      - Conservation quantity error method adaptive step sizing [#]_.

      - Full dispersion and propagation loss.

      - Self-steepening, self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing (co- and cross-polarized), cross-phase modulation between polarization and wavelength components, and the full polarization-resolved Raman response [#]_.

    * The Giles model for gain and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) [#]_.

      - Full integration of gain with the GNLSE for accurate modelling of highly nonlinear amplifiers.

      - Full boundary value solver for co and counter propagating pump and ASE light as well as a single-pass solver for rapid estimation of amplifier performance.

      - Core- and cladding-pumped fibre amplifiers.

      - A choice of frequency-domain or hybrid time- and frequency-domain operators.

    * Dispersion control.

      - Grating-based pulse compressors [#]_ (see also [#]_) including material reflectivity profiles and a scalar model of diffraction efficiency [#]_.

      - Single-mode fibre (SMF) pulse compression.

      - Optimization of grating and SMF compressors for maximized peak power.

      - Fibre Bragg gratings.

    * Quantum noise contributions including shot noise [#]_ and partition noise at partially reflective interfaces [#]_.

    * A comprehensive plot library with full Matplotlib functionality.

    * Easy integration with python's multiprocessing module for parallel CPU computing.

    * The freedom to customize all of the above.

pyLaserPulse uses python loops sparingly, relying instead on the numpy and scipy modules for most calculations to benefit from the highly optimized libraries on which these modules are based. Simulation execution time is therefore reasonable, and a modern laptop CPU (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H) can complete a typical nonlinear amplifier simulation (full GNLSE with co- and counter-propagating pump and ASE) in less than 5 s. A full system model comprising multiple amplifier stages, compression, and supercontinuum generation completes in a few minutes on the same processor (although systems which have large stretching ratios, such as fibre CPAs, require more time).

Example 1 - A nonlinear Yb-doped fibre amplifier
================================================
The example below shows how to model a simple Yb-doped fibre amplifier comprised of off-the-shelf components using the ``catalogue_components`` module. A hybrid isolator/WDM precedes a 1 m length of step-index Yb-doped fibre which is core pumped in the signal propagation direction at 916 nm. The amplifier is seeded with a 150 fs, sech\ :sup:`2`\  input pulse with a peak power of 150 W and 30 dB polarization purity.

The ``optical_assemblies`` module used in the example above not only provides a simple way of turning a collection of component models into a convenient *assembly* which can then be simulated in a single line, it also generates plots which can be displayed using the ``single_plot_window.matplotlib_gallery`` module. The latter includes an intuitive, Qt-based gallery of plot thumbnails which, when clicked, are launched in a standard Matplotlib figure for full control over the plot visuals, axis limits, scaling, etc., as shown in the animation below.

    :align: center

All components have a ``verbose`` keyword argument, but this is overridden by the same keyword argument passed to the ``__init__`` method of classes in the ``optical_assemblies`` module. When True, information about the progress of the simulation is printed to the terminal. The output for this example is given below. The amplifier name is printed, as well as the name of each component, the percentage propagation for the input and output fibres of each component, and the convergence of the boundary value solver for the active fibre.

Example 2 - Optical wavebreaking in all-normal-dispersion PCF and grating-based pulse compression
=================================================================================================

The code below models supercontinuum generation in PCF and compression of the spectrally-broadened pulses using a grating-based compressor. 100 fs, 5 kW seed pulses with a central wavelength of 1050 nm first pass through a free-space isolator (modelled using the ``base_components.component`` class) before being coupling into the PCF (modelled using the ``catalogue_components.passive_fibre.NKT_NL_1050_NEG_1`` class). The spectrally broadened and chirped pulses then propagate through the compressor (modelled using the ``base_components.grating_compressor`` class). The ``optimize`` keyword argument is set to ``True`` when the compressor is instantiated, so the compressor will be optimized for maximum pulse peak power by adjusting the grating angle and separation (diffraction efficiency vs. angle of incidence is incorporated automatically). The ``verbose`` keyword argument, also set to ``True``, means that the results of this optimization will be printed to the terminal.

Documentation is still in progress, but the docstrings are detailed and there are example scripts which show how to model active and passive fibre systems and give a general overview of how to use pyLaserPulse (see pyLaserPulse/examples).

A lot of work has gone into debugging and finding 'gotchas', but these will spring up from time to time. If you have questions, comments, a bug to report, or suggestions for improvement, please get in touch via pylaserpulse@outlook.com.
